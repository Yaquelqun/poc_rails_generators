This application is a basic application for me to test out how to create custom generators. More information on how rails generators operate can be found on the `Rails generator` obsidian page

## Installation
  Basic rails app installation. Clone the repo and run a good ol bundle install. No DB or anything

## Stimulus generator
  First generator that i created following this [honey badger article](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/build-a-rails-generator/)
  ```
    rails g stimulus toggle --actions toggle hide
  ```
  Generator is tested
